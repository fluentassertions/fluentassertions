        We welcome bug reports! Please see our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-a-good-bug-report) for more information on writing a good bug report.
        
        **Before continuing, have you:**

          * Tried upgrading to newest version of Fluent Assertions, to see if your issue has already been resolved and released?
          * Checked existing open *and* closed [issues](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue), to see if the issue has already been reported?
          * Tried reproducing your problem in a new isolated project?
          * Read the [documentation](https://fluentassertions.com/introduction)?
          * Searched the two [test](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/tree/main/Tests/FluentAssertions.Specs) [suites](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/tree/main/Tests/FluentAssertions.Equivalency.Specs) if there is a test documenting the expected behavior?
          * Considered if this is a general question and not a bug? For general questions please use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fluent-assertions?mixed=1).

        Please include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small project, with steps to run it.
        Always include text as text rather than screenshots so code can easily be copied and will show up in searches.
        Stack Overflow has a great article about [how to create a minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

        Did this work in a previous release of Fluent Assertions? If you can try a previous release to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don't know, that's OK.
