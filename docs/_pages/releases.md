## 5.6.0

**Fixes**
* Provide opt-out to `AssertionOptions(o => o.WithStrictOrdering())` - #974 
* Add collection assertion `ContainEquivalentOf` - #950
* Add `Should().NotThrowAfter` assertion for actions - #942

Kudos to @BrunoJuchli, @matthiaslischka and @frederik-h for these amazing additions. 

## 5.5.3

**Fixes**
* Performance fixes in `BeEquivalenTo` - #935 
* Reverted 5.5.0 changes to `AssertionScope` to ensure binary compatibility - #977

## 5.5.2

**Fixes**
* Allows `BeEquivalentTo` to handle a non-generic collection as the SUT - #975, #973
* Optimized performance of `IncludeMemberByPathSelectionRule` - #969

## 5.5.1

**What's New**
* Now provides a hint when strings differ in length and contain differences - #915, #907
* Added `ThrowAsync`, `ThrowExactlyAsync` and `NotThrowAsync` - #931
* Added support for `Should().Throw` and `Should().NotThrow` for `Func<T>` - #951
* Added support for `private protected` access modifier - #932
* Updated `BeApproximately` to support nullable types for both the subject and the expectation nullable - #934
* Added `async` version of `ExecutionTime` to - #938
* Updated `NotBeApproximately` to accepting nullable subject and expectation - #939
* `type.Should().Be(type)` now support open generics - #954, #955 

**Fixes**
* Minor performance improvements to prevent rendering messages if a test did not fail - #921, #915
* Improve performance of `Should().AllBeEquivalentTo()` - #920, #914
* Improve the presentation of enums to include the value and the number - #923, #897
* `BeEquivalentTo` with `WithStrictOrdering` produced messy failure message - #918
* Fixes detecting checking equivalency of a `null` subject to a dictionary - #933
* Fixes duplicate conversions being mentioned in the output of the equivalency API - #941
* Comparing an object graph against `IEnumerable` now works now as expected - #911
* Selecting members during object graph assertions now better handles `new` overrides -#960, #956 

**Note** In versions prior to 5.5, FA may have skipped certain properties in the equivalency comparison. #960 fixes this, so this may cause some breaking changes. 

Lots of kudos @jnyrup and @krajek for a majority for the work in this release.
