The following assertions are available to all types of objects.

```csharp
object theObject = null;
theObject.Should().BeNull("because the value is null");
theObject.Should().NotBeNull();

theObject = "whatever";
theObject.Should().BeOfType<string>("because a {0} is set", typeof(string));
theObject.Should().BeOfType(typeof(string), "because a {0} is set", typeof(string));
```

Sometimes you might like to first assert that an object is of a certain type using `BeOfType` and then continue with additional assertions on the result of casting that object to the specified type.
You can do that by chaining those assertions onto the `Which` property like this.

```csharp
someObject.Should().BeOfType<Exception>()
  .Which.Message.Should().Be("Other Message");
```

To assert that two objects are equal (through their implementation of `Object.Equals`), use

```csharp
string otherObject = "whatever";
theObject.Should().Be(otherObject, "because they have the same values");
theObject.Should().NotBe(otherObject);
```

To assert that an object is equal to one of the provided objects, you can use

```csharp
theObject.Should().BeOneOf(obj1, obj2, obj3);
```

To assert object equality using a custom equality comparer, you can use

```csharp
theObject.Should().Be(otherObject, new ObjEqualityComparer());
theObject.Should().NotBe(otherObject, new ObjEqualityComparer());
theObject.Should().BeOneOf(new[] { obj1, obj2, obj3 }, new ObjEqualityComparer());
```

If you want to make sure two objects are not just functionally equal but refer to the exact same object in memory, use the following two methods.

```csharp
theObject = otherObject;
theObject.Should().BeSameAs(otherObject);
theObject.Should().NotBeSameAs(otherObject);
```

Other examples of some general purpose assertions include

```csharp
var ex = new ArgumentException();
ex.Should().BeAssignableTo<Exception>("because it is an exception");
ex.Should().NotBeAssignableTo<DateTime>("because it is an exception");

var dummy = new Object();
dummy.Should().Match(d => (d.ToString() == "System.Object"));
dummy.Should().Match<string>(d => (d == "System.Object"));
dummy.Should().Match((string d) => (d == "System.Object"));
```

As an alternative to using predicate matching, it is also possible to use element inspectors to do nested assertions in a fluent way.

```csharp
var productDto = new ProductDto
{
    Name = "Some product name",
    Price = 19.95,
    SKU = "ABC12345",
    Store = new Store
    {
        Country = "Germany",
        Quantity = 42
    }
};

productDto.Should().Satisfy<ProductDto>(dto =>
{
    dto.Name.Should().Be("Some product name");
    dto.Price.Should().Be(19.95);
    dto.SKU.Should().EndWith("12345");
    dto.Store.Should().Satisfy<Store>(store =>
    {
        store.Country.Should().Be("Germany");
        store.Quantity.Should().BeGreaterThan(40);
    });
});
```

Some users requested the ability to easily downcast an object to one of its derived classes in a fluent way.

```csharp
customer.Animals.First().As<Human>().Height.Should().Be(178);
```

Weâ€™ve also added the possibility to assert that an object can be serialized and deserialized using the XML or data contract formatters.

```csharp
theObject.Should().BeXmlSerializable();
theObject.Should().BeDataContractSerializable();
```

These test that _this specific object_, with the values it has in its members, will round-trip through XML or DataContract serialization. Members that are marked `[XmlIgnore]` (XML serialization), `[IgnoreDataMember]` (DataContract serialization) or `[NonSerialized]` (types marked `[Serializable]`) are excluded from this comparison, as their values will by definition never roundtrip.

The XML serialization infrastructure supports marking fields and properties with the `[XmlIgnore]` attribute. Similarly, members in a `[DataContract]` can be marked `[IgnoreDataMember]`. With legacy binary serialization, fields can be marked `[NonSerialized]`, and the DataContract serializer will respect this when serializing classes marked `[Serializable]`.

When members are marked in this way, the serialized form produced omits the specified members. When deserializing it, the members are not populated with anything. This is the case even if the serialized form is XML that contains elements matching ignored members.

The `BeXmlSerializable` and `BeDataContractSerializable` assertions ignore ignored members, since their values cannot possibly round-trip through the serialization process.
