     "There''s a life before Fluent Assertions, and there''s a life after it" [Meisam Alifallahi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meisam-alifallahi/)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Fluent Assertions is a very extensive set of extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or
     BDD-style unit tests. Works with .NET Standard 2.0 and higher, .NET Framework 4.7 and higher and .NET 6 and higher.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Versions 8 and beyond are free for open-source projects and non-commercial use, but commercial use requires 
     a [paid license](https://xceed.com/products/unit-testing/fluent-assertions/). 
     Check out the [license page](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/blob/main/LICENSE) for more information. Version 7 
     will remain fully open-source indefinitely and receive bugfixes and other important corrections.
